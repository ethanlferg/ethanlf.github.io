        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my page! This is a fun experience for me because I'm learning new, important skills: programming and coding! Since you're here, I might as well introduce myself: I'm Ethan. Some things that I like to do include playing tennis, video games, and playing bass! I've been playing bass for just over a year (starting in May 2021). However, I have been playing guitar since 2003. I've also been in the Tech industry as a QA since 2017. I am passionate about what I do and am looking to constantly improve! Since I am working on my skills, I'd like to tell you about my goals.</p>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>As I continue down this path of learning how to program and code, I want to achieve the following:</p>
        <ul class="goal-list">
            <li>Create a website</li>
            <li>Learn Javascript</li>
            <li>Build something super cool</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'm passionate about personal finance, tennis, and my family. One of my projects that I hope to work on in my learning process is to build out a budgeting tool that my family can use! We are extensive budgeters and rely on our budgeting app to ensure we stay on track. However, building something from scratch not only brings accomplishment in my new skills, but pride in something that I can use and enjoy on a daily basis!</p>
        <p>Keep checking back for more projects!</p>
